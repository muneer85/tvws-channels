# Universal TVWS Channel Scanner 
A generalized and flexible universal graphical user interface (GUI) tool to evaluate the availability and usability of the TV whitespace (TVWS) channels and their noise levels in any geographical region. The developed tool has many features and capabilities such as scanning the TVWS spectrum for any geographical area in the world and any TVWS frequency band. Moreover, it allows the user to apply widely used terrain-based radio propagation models. It provides the flexibility to import the elevation terrain profile of any region with the desired spatial accuracy and resolution. In addition, various system parameters including regulation rules can be modified in the tool. This tool exports to an external dataset file the output data of the available and usable channels and their noise levels and it also visualizes these data interactively.
