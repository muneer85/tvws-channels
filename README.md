# Universal TVWS Channel Scanner 
A generalized and flexible universal graphical user interface (GUI) tool to evaluate the availability and usability of the TV whitespace (TVWS) channels and their noise levels in any geographical region. The developed tool has many features and capabilities such as scanning the TVWS spectrum for any geographical area in the world and any TVWS frequency band. Moreover, this tool provide an RF planning
and optimization algorithm to evaluate the various communication metrics between the TVWS BS and the UEs (e.g.,WSDs), including received signal strength (RSS), pathloss, signalto-noise ratio (SNR), data rate, fade margin, and line-of-sight (LOS) availability. This tool also provides an RF optimization technique using Ray Tracing to find the best azimuth and elevation orientation for both the BS and the UE antennas.Moreover, it allows the user to apply widely used terrain-based radio propagation models. It provides the flexibility to import the elevation terrain profile of any region with the desired spatial accuracy and resolution. In addition, various system parameters including regulation rules can be modified in the tool. This tool exports to an external dataset file the output data of the available and usable channels and their noise levels and it also visualizes these data interactively.
